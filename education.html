        <div class="heading">What's an EARTHQUAKE!!!</div>
        <br>
        <p >An earthquake (also known as a quake, tremor or temblor) is the shaking of the surface of the Earth, resulting from the sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in size from those that are so weak that they cannot be felt to those violent enough to toss people around and destroy whole cities. The seismicity, or seismic activity, of an area is the frequency, type and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time. The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling.
            At the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and displacing or disrupting the ground. When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami. Earthquakes can also trigger landslides and occasionally, volcanic activity. </p>

        <div class="heading">What's an SEISMOGRAPH</div>
        <br><p>A simple seismometer, sensitive to up-down motions of the Earth, is like a weight hanging from a spring, both suspended from a frame that moves along with any motion detected. The relative motion between the weight (called the mass) and the frame provides a measurement of the vertical ground motion. A rotating drum is attached to the frame and a pen is attached to the weight, thus recording any ground motion in a seismogram.

            Any movement of the ground moves the frame. The mass tends not to move because of its inertia, and by measuring the movement between the frame and the mass, the motion of the ground can be determined.
            
            Early seismometers used optical levers or mechanical linkages to amplify the small motions involved, recording on soot-covered paper or photographic paper. Modern instruments use electronics. In some systems, the mass is held nearly motionless relative to the frame by an electronic negative feedback loop. The motion of the mass relative to the frame is measured, and the feedback loop applies a magnetic or electrostatic force to keep the mass nearly motionless. The voltage needed to produce this force is the output of the seismometer, which is recorded digitally. </p>

            <li>Natural events such as volcanic eruptions and meteor impacts can cause earthquakes, but the majority of naturally-occurring earthquakes are triggered by movement of the earth's plates.</li><br>
            <li>The earth's surface consists of 20 constantly moving plates. The pressure increase from shifting plates can cause the crust to break. This break allows stress to be released as energy, which moves through the earth in the form of waves (aka earthquakes).</li><br>
            <li>Normally, it's not the shaking ground itself that claims lives during an earthquake. It's the associated destruction of man-made structures and the instigation of other natural disasters such as tsunamis, avalanches and landslides. Not only is it important to have a plan for yourself in the case of an earthquake, but your pets need a disaster plan as well. Create an earthquake plan for the animals around so if disaster strikes, you’ll be prepared. </li>
            <li>The National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) records an average of 20,000 earthquakes every year (about 50 a day) around the world. There are, however, millions of earthquakes estimated to occur every year that are too weak to be recorded</li>
            <li>Each year the southern California area has about 10,000 earthquakes -- the majority of which go unnoticed. However, if there is a large earthquake the aftershock sequence will produce many more earthquakes of all magnitudes for months.</li>
            <li>Almost 80% of all the planet's earthquakes occur along the rim of the Pacific Ocean, called the "Ring of Fire"; a region that encircles the Pacific Ocean and is home to 452 volcanoes (over 75% of the world's active and dormant volcanoes).</li>
            <li>The largest recorded earthquake in the United States was a magnitude 9.2 that struck Prince William Sound, Alaska on March 28, 1964.</li>
            <li>The largest recorded earthquake in the world was a magnitude 9.5 in Chile on May 22, 1960.</li>
            <li>When the Chilean earthquake occurred in 1960, seismographs recorded seismic waves that traveled around the world. These seismic waves shook the entire earth for many days.</li>
            <li>An undersea earthquake in the Indian Ocean triggered a series of devastating tsunamis on Dec. 26, 2004. The tsunamis struck the coasts of most landmasses bordering the Indian Ocean, bringing 100-foot waves and killing over 225,000 people in 11 countries</li>
            <li>Alaska is the most earthquake-prone state and one of the most seismically active regions in the world. The region experiences a magnitude 7.0 earthquake almost every year and a magnitude 8.0 or greater earthquake approximately once every 14 years</li>

        <div class="heading">What Should I Do Before, During, And After An Earthquake?</div>
        <br>
        <div class="heading">What to Do Before an Earthquake</div>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure you have a fire extinguisher, first aid kit, a battery-powered radio, a flashlight, and extra batteries at home. </li>
            <li>Learn first aid. </li>
            <li>Learn how to turn off the gas, water, and electricity. </li>
            <li>Make up a plan of where to meet your family after an earthquake. </li>
            <li>Don't leave heavy objects on shelves (they'll fall during a quake). </li>
            <li>Anchor heavy furniture, cupboards, and appliances to the walls or floor. </li>
            <li>Learn the earthquake plan at your school or workplace. </li>
        </ul>
        <br><div class="heading">What to Do During an Earthquake</div>
        <ul>
            <li>Stay calm! If you're indoors, stay inside. If you're outside, stay outside. </li>
            <li>If you're indoors, stand against a wall near the center of the building, stand in a doorway, or crawl under heavy furniture (a desk or table). Stay away from windows and outside doors. </li>
            <li>If you're outdoors, stay in the open away from power lines or anything that might fall. Stay away from buildings (stuff might fall off the building or the building could fall on you). </li>
            <li>Don't use matches, candles, or any flame. Broken gas lines and fire don't mix. </li>
            <li>Don't use elevators (they'll probably get stuck anyway). </li>
        </ul>
        <br><div class="heading">What to Do After an Earthquake</div>
        <ul>
            <li>Check yourself and others for injuries. Provide first aid for anyone who needs it. </li>
            <li>Stay out of damaged buildings. </li>
            <li>Be careful of chimneys (they may fall on you). </li>
            <li>Stay away from damaged areas. </li>
            <li>Expect aftershocks. </li>
        </ul>
